# Message Router
Efficiency and Performance Evaluation of Message Consumption and Storage Solutions using Kafka Message Queues

# Arhitecture diagram 
This project aims to address the challenge of parsing messages from diverse sources across controlled gateways, routing them based on internal logic, and storing them in Kafka queues. The idea is to develop solutions using Integration Studio and Ballerina, facilitating faster application development and streamlining the CI/CD pipeline while evaluating their performance. Through this comparative study, we seek to identify the most effective approach for meeting the requirements of message handling and processing in a distributed environment
